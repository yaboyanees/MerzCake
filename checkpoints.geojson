After the Disengagement responsibility for the crossing was handed over to the Palestinian Authority, and the checkpoint was administered by Palestinian and Egyptian security forces supervised by a European Union force. After the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, the crossing remained largely closed on Israeli orders. Once Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, the EU force left Gaza and the crossing was shut down completely. The crossing was reopened only in November 2011, after the Egyptian uprising. Following the Egyptian coup in 2013, travel through the crossing was cut back."
