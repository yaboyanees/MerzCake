    "Electric Vehicle Market UpdateNotable Updates \nElectric vehicle (EV) market sales and model availability continue to rise: \n\u2022\tBy the end of 2022, over 10.3 million light-duty EVs were sold worldwide making every one in seven \nlight-duty vehicles sold an EV. \n\u2022\tIn the United States, more than 800,000 light-duty EVs were purchased in 2022, a 65 percent increase \nfrom 2021. The first quarter of 2023 saw EV sales reach over 258,000 units, almost a 45 percent year \nover year increase. \n\u2022\tThe number of light-duty electrified models available in the U.S. is projected to reach 197 by the end of \n2025, up five percent from the previous EV Market Report\u2019s projection. \n\u2022\tGlobal model availability for medium- and heavy-duty EVs rose from 609 models to 808 models \navailable for purchase, between 2021 until the end of 2022. Additionally, CALSTART estimates that the \nUnited States and Canada will experience steady growth from 166 models to 213 models available for \npurchase, between 2021 and 2023. \nAuto manufacturers are continually expanding EV sales targets and climate commitments:\n\u2022\tHonda  announced its goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The automaker recently announced \nthe creation of a new operational division that would strengthen its electrification business and became \neffective April 1, 2023. Honda also announced several partnerships, including a collaboration with \nGeneral Motors (GM) to co-develop EVs worldwide starting in 2027, and a partnership with Sony to \nproduce battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in North America under the brand Afeela in 2025. \n\u2022\tMitsubishi  announced that it expects 100 percent of its global sales to come from EVs by 2035 and will \nbe releasing four new EVs in the same timeframe. Mitsubishi stated that one of the EVs to be released \nby 2035 will come from its alliance with Nissan and another from its alliance with Renault.  \n\u2022\tStellantis \u2019 Jeep brand announced plans to release four new EV models in North America and Europe by \nthe end of 2025, with production for one of the models expected to begin in 2024. By 2024, Stellantis\u2019 \nDodge and Ram brands are expecting to release several new EV models, including the launch of an \nelectric Ram pickup truck.  \nDemand from Medium- and Heavy-Duty (M/HD) fleet operators for EVs has grown tremendously:\n\u2022\tUSPS  announced that it will purchase an additional 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric delivery vans.  \n\u2022\tPride Group , the second largest refuse fleet in the U.S., ordered 200 Freightliner eCascadia Class 8 electric \ntrucks and 50 Freightliner eM2 Class 6-7 electric trucks starting in mid-2023, with the intention of switching \nits local delivery fleet to 100 percent EVs within the next one to two years. \nNotable Updates       5",
    "Electric Vehicle Market UpdateIn 2022, worldwide light-duty EV sales reached 10.3 million \nvehicles based on an analysis by Bloomberg.1 According \nto Bloomberg\u2019s 2022 Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook, \nglobal light-duty EV sales are set to grow rapidly in the \nnext few years, rising to 21 million in 2025;2 and according \nto an S&P Global Platts\u2019 report, global light-duty EV sales \nare projected to reach 26.8 million in 2030.3 Additionally, \nBloomberg estimates that global on-road light-duty EVs are \nexpected to hit 77 million by 2025 and 229 million by 2030.4 \nBy the end of 2023, Bloomberg estimates that there should \nbe about 40 million EVs on the road globally, corresponding \nto roughly three percent of the global vehicle fleet.5 \nIn the medium- and heavy-duty (M/HD) market, global M/\nHD EVs doubled over 2020 volumes with 14,200 units sold, \nrepresenting 0.3 percent of all global M/HD vehicle sales in \n2021.6 Although IEA has not released its Global EV Outlook \nfor 2022, it is expected that global M/HD EV volumes and \nsales further increased in 2022. A study from the North \nAmerican Council for Freight Efficiency and RMI shows that \nmore than half of the U.S.\u2019s commercial M/HD vehicles and \nall vans and step vans are immediately electrifiable.7 This \nstudy conservatively estimates that full electrification of the \n4.2 million active Class 3-6 vans and steps vans in North \nAmerica could reduce more than 43 million metric tons of \nCO2e emissions annually, the equivalent of nearly five billion \ngallons of diesel a year.8  Light-Duty EV Model Availability\n \nThe United States auto industry saw an overall decrease in \ntotal new vehicles sold in 2022, but EVs sold continued in \nan upward trend. In the U.S., more than 800,000 light-duty \nEVs were purchased in 2022, a 65 percent increase from \n2021.9 Cox Automotive predicts that 2023 will be the first \nyear that the U.S. light-duty market reaches one million EV \nsales.10 \nIn 2022, EV market share was just below six percent at \n5.8 percent, up from the 3.2 percent market share seen in \n2021.11 The first quarter of 2023 saw EV sales reach over \n258,000 units, almost a 45 percent year over year increase, \nwhich accounted for 7.2 percent of all new-vehicle sales in \nthe quarter.12,13 \nEV demand has been growing quickly as consumers head \ninto 2023 and look forward to 2024 and new electrified \nmodel offerings. In January and February of 2022, \nConsumer Reports (CR) surveyed Americans on their \nthoughts about BEVs and low carbon fuels.14 The survey \nfound that 71 percent of Americans surveyed expressed \nsome level of interest in buying or leasing a BEV with 14 \npercent indicating that they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d buy or lease \ntoday, up from four percent in their 2020 survey.15 Digging 54\n26\n6%10.3The Growing EV Market\nAccording to analysts, global light-duty EV \nsales could rise from 10.3 million vehicles \nsold in 2022 to 26 million in 2030 and 54 \nmillion in 2040. \n2040 20302022In millions of\nlight-duty\nEVs sold\nModel Availability and Manufacturer Commitments       6EV Sales, Model Availability & \nManufacturer Commitments d",
    "Electric Vehicle Market Updatefurther, the survey found that 33 percent of Americans say \nthat it is the fact that it costs less to charge an EV than it \ndoes to refuel an internal combustion enginge (ICE) vehicle, \nwould make them consider purchasing an EV; 31 percent \nindicated that the lower lifetime costs would affect their \ndecision, and 28 percent cited lower maintenance costs. \nWhen asked what posed barriers to EV adoption, 61 percent \nsaid charging logistics, 55 percent said vehicle range, and \n52 percent said costs associated with buying, owning, and \nmaintaining an EV. Progress is being made on expanding \ncharging infrastructure across the United States, with \nmore than 52,000 public charging stations available as \nof April 2023.16 The survey also found that almost half of \nAmericans are unaware of the incentives that are available \nto them when purchasing an EV.\nIn February 2023, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics examined \nthe main factors associated with the increased demand for \nEVs. Environmental concerns, increased vehicle options, \nimproved battery capacity, and fuel cost savings are the \nfactors that will continue to increase EV demand over the \nnext decade.17 Many Americans have expressed concern \nover the environmental impacts associated with owning \nan ICE vehicle as a top consideration when purchasing \nan EV. With the median EV\u2019s range reaching 234 miles \non a single charge in 2022, range anxiety is dwindling as \nbattery technology advances.18 Additionally, automakers \ncontinue to increase the number of EV models available \nfor purchase, providing consumers with a more expansive \nportfolio to choose from. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) EV incentives, there \nwill be five light-duty EV models available with a net cost \nof under $30,000 by the end of 2023. Additionally, by the \nend of 2023, there projected to be 15 light-duty EV models \navailable for under $40,000 manufacturer\u2019s suggested \nretail price (MSRP) with a driving range of over 100 miles. \nIn addition to these declining upfront purchase prices, \nmany analyses conclude that EVs will provide substantial \nconsumer savings in avoided fuel and maintenance costs. \nFor instance, ICCT found that when considering IRA \nincentives for EVs purchased in 2025, consumers could \nsave between $6,600 to $11,000 in the first six-years \nof ownership in associated fuel and maintenance costs \ncompared to ICE vehicle ownership, with the greatest \nsavings found for pickup trucks and SUVs.19 \n \nThe consumer demand for EVs can be seen through vehicle \nreservations and deliveries. For example, Hyundai\u2019s IONIQ6 \nsold out pre-orders within 24 hours of its release;20 Polestar \nsold over 51,000 EVs and delivered 21,000 EVs in the last \nquarter of 2022;21 Ford sold over 60,000 electric vehicles in \n2022, a 127 percent increase from 2021;22 VW has delivered \n500,000 ID. EVs worldwide, one year ahead of schedule;23  \nBMW delivered over 215,000 EVs worldwide;24 and \nMercedes delivered more than 117,000 EVs worldwide. \nBased on announcements by major auto manufacturers, the \nnumber of electrified models available in the U.S. is projected \nto reach 197 by the end of 2025, with over 58 new models \nslated to launch in model years 2022-2025.*\n020406080100120140160180200\n2010 2015 2020 2025Historic Total\nProjected TotalTotal Available Light-Duty EV Models\nModel Availability and Manufacturer Commitments       7* Vehicles included in this figure accounts for confirmed and aspirational electrified model availability targets that are available or will become available in the U.S. \nwith MSRPs below $100,000. The number of available vehicle models will be greater when considering global EV announcements and models that cost more than \n$100,000. Additionally, a model was only counted once although various battery sizes, ranges, and prices may be available. For example, Ford\u2019s F-150 Lightning was \ncounted once but is available in Pro, XLT, Lariat, and Platinum; and for performance range options,the Leaf and Leaf e-Plus were counted as a single vehicle.Figure 1.

This Figure does consider unconfirmed or aspirational electrified \nmodel availability targets set by automakers but does not consider models without an expected availability year. \nMedium- and Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicle Model Availability\nIn the medium- and heavy-duty market, model availability is also rapidly increasing. Globally, CALSTART estimated that \nthe number of zero-emission truck (ZET) and bus models available in the market today has grown nearly 33 percent from \n2021 until the end of 2022, rising from 609 models to 808 models.25 The largest growth came from zero-emission cargo \nvan (91 models available, up from 58 models) and heavy-duty truck (107 models available for purchase, up from 57 models) \nsegments, growing 56 percent and 87 percent year over year respectively between 2021 and 2022.26 Zero-emission medium-\nduty step van model availability increased from 17 models to 20 over the same timeframe, and zero-emission transit buses \nincreased from 251 models to 285 models available for purchase--the majority of which are available in China.27 CALSTART\u2019s \nreport estimates that the United States and Canada will experience steady growth from 166 models to 213 models available \nfor purchase, between 2021 to 2023 (see Figure below for the U.S. and Canada\u2019s cumulative model availability by vehicle \ntype).28 Additionally, ZET battery ranges are improving and according to manufacturer data, reported by CALSTART, medium-\nduty ZETs, medium-duty step vans, and cargo vans have median ranges of 173 miles, 150 miles, and 164 miles, respectively.29 Number of Available Models\nModel Availability and Manufacturer Commitments       8020406080100120140\nSedans2023 2024      2025SUV2023 2024       2025Truck/VansPHEV\nBEV\n2023 2024     2025Cumulative Announced  BEV and PHEV Models\n Available Figure 2.

    "Electric Vehicle Market UpdateCommercial Fleet Electrification \nCommitments \nA few years ago, the commercial fleet EV market in the U.S. \nwas dominated by transit buses. However, the demand \nfrom medium- and heavy-duty fleet operators to pursue \nother electric vehicle options has grown in recent years. \nIn addition, light-duty vehicle manufacturers like Ford, \nTesla, and Polestar have begun to partner with light-duty \ncommercial fleet operators to meet the growing demand for \nthese electrified vehicles.  \nThe Environmental Defense Fund, which regularly tracks \ncommercial fleet deployments and commitments, shows \nthat deployments are on the rise as fleets are committing \nto and deploying EVs at a significant rate (see Table 1. \nSample of Fleet Electrification Commitments for greater \ndetail). Companies that operate large fleets are taking note; \nsee major orders updates below.

    "Electric Vehicle Market UpdateConclusion\nOver the next five to ten years, the auto industry, governments, fleets, and individual vehicle owners \nwill transition more and more to zero-emission vehicles. By 2025, it is estimated that there will be \napproximately 197 BEV and PHEV passenger vehicle models available to U.S. consumers. \n2022 ended with over 10.3 million light-duty electric vehicles sold worldwide. In the U.S., 2022 saw \nthe addition of more than 800,000 new light-duty EVs: a 65 percent increase from 2021, and there \nwere over 200 electric models of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The first quarter of 2023 was \nsuccessful for the U.S. EV auto industry where sales reached over 258,000 units, an almost 45 percent \nyear-over-year increase and accounting for 7.2 percent of all new-vehicle sales. As evidenced by the \nsteady upward trend in ZEV sales, electrification is becoming an attractive option to consumers and \nfleets alike for fuel and maintenance savings, as well as the ability to impact air quality and climate \nchange goals. Major auto manufacturers are listening to consumer preferences and are embracing \nelectrification. This can be seen by the increased number and variety of electrified models offered, as \nwell as commitments to brand electrification and increased sales target.\nConclusion       16",
