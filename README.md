# Introduction to MerzCake Data Visualization Technique
MerzCake offers a new way to convey the 'part-to-whole' relationship within your data, which enabls your audience to easily comprehend how a total amount is distributed across various categories in time and space. MerzCake draws inspiration from stacked column charts and pie charts.

The cool features from this data visualization concept is the ability to:
- üåê Spatially arrange the nodes, which is great for GIS applications
- ‚ÜîÔ∏è Dynamic Sizing of nodes based on the total of each layer of the cake
- üï∏Ô∏è Show a central node that is sized according to all the contributing node sizes at each layer

## Getting Started
1. Clone / download the code repo OR just the html file
2. set your layer colors for each section that you want represented. Here is an example of 4 layers / categories: `const nodeColors = ['#ef476f', '#ffd166', '#06d6a0', '#118ab2'];`
3. define your central node position and size. Here is an example of putting with 4 layers and initialized heights array of 4 zeros: `const centralNode = {x: 400, y: 300, heights: [0, 0, 0, 0]};` *If you have only 3 layers, just make sure to remove one of these zeros and remove one of the colors above.*
4. put your data into this format for each node, where x and y are the position and heights are each section value: `const nodesData = [{ x: 100, y: 100, heights: [20, 15, 15, 5] }];`
5. enjoy another way to view and present your dataset!

## How it works?
This visualization uses the HTML `canvas` element to draw the node graphics, on the fly, with JavaScript. My somewhat faulty approach to solving this challenge was to:
1. draw each node as a stacked column comprised of different sections
2. set the width equal to the height so I can have each node as a square
3. clip the square by using radius (height/2) to make a circle
4. draw a dotted line from all nodes to a central node

## Call 4 Help
I welcome any and all feedback to make this better and more usable. I am not a developer and recognize that there may be better ways to accomplish what I'm envisioning. I couldn't find any developer that was interested to do this project with me so I did it with lots of back and forth between chatGPT and stackoverflow.

## Milestone Tracking
- [x] Write the readme content
- [x] Refactor the code to be accept dynamic inputs
- [ ] Rewrite the height calculation of each section to take into account the area
- [ ] Get this to a point where others would love to use in their projects
- [ ] Make it into some data visualization library like d3.js, powerBI, tableau, excel, etc.
