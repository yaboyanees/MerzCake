# Introduction to MerzCake Data Visualization Technique
MerzCake takes its inspiration from the stacked column chart and a pie chart to create another interesting view of the dataset. The cool features that I like from this data visualization that are hard in other visualizations is the ability to:
- ✅ Spatially arrange the nodes, which is great for GIS applications
- ✅ Dynamic Sizing of nodes based on the total of each layer of the cake
- ✅ Show a central node that is sized according to all the contributing node sizes at each layer 

## Milestone Tracking
- [x] Write the readme content
- [x] Refactor the code to be accept dynamic inputs
- [ ] Rewrite the height calculation of each section to take into account the area

## How can I help?
I welcome any and all feedback to make this better. I am not a developer and like to stay more on the idea / product side of things. I just couldn't find anyone that wanted to do this project with me so I did it myself with lots of back and forth with chatGPT and stackoverflow.
